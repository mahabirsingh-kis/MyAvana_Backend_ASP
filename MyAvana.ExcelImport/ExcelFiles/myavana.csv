The rich Omega Oils soften hair, and hold moisture so that hair feels soft and smooth. The best way to apply it is to rub a small amount between your hands to dry, or almost dry, clean hair from roots to ends one section at a time, and rake through. Wrap your hair in a towel for at least 5 minutes and then follow with a gentle curl-friendly shampoo. For extra conditioning, keep it in overnight and wash hair in the morning.</li> <li><strong>Scalp Treatment</strong> -&nbsp;To soothe an itchy and/or dry scalp, spray 1 pump directly onto irritated area and work into scalp using fingers. Oil can be left on scalp until next shampoo day. Do not use on open wounds or broken skin.</li> <li><strong>Makeup Primer</strong> -&nbsp;Dry Oil Elixir is a great way to set skin for makeup application. A little goes a long way, so spray a small amount onto hands and work into the face until fully absorbed, paying special attention to hairline, cheeks, and around the nose (driest parts of face). Your face is now ready&nbsp;for make-up!</li> <li><strong>Makeup Remover + Cleanser Combo</strong> - Dry Oil Elixir gently and effortlessly dissolves impurities and makeup and leaves skin with a beautiful, healthy look and clean feel. Apply 1-2 pumps to face with fingertips or cotton pad. Gently massage until all makeup is removed and face feels cleansed.</li> <li><strong>Face + Body Moisturizer</strong> -&nbsp;When you hop out of the shower, ditch the chemical-filled and greasy body lotion for a dry oil treatment to lock the moisture in. No need for a separate face cream&hellip;the Dry Oil Elixir is good for you from head to toe!</li> <li><strong>Natural Hair Sheen</strong> -&nbsp;Want to add some shine to dry and dull hair? Spray 2-3 pumps on dry or almost dry hair and with hands, press the oil into the ends of your hair until absorbed. We love using the Dry Oil Elixir as an all-natural styling sheen for natural hair or for braids and extensions!</li> <li><strong>Beard Oil</strong> -&nbsp;Hey Guys! We wouldn&rsquo;t leave you out. Use the Dry Oil Elixir to keep your beards soft, shiny, and healthy. The best time to apply Dry Oil Elixir to a beard is after a hot shower, when beards are cleanest and softest; this is when they will most easily absorb the oils. Spray 1-2 pumps onto hands and work into a clean and dry beard until absorbed.</li> <li><strong>Cuticle + Nail Treatment</strong> -&nbsp;Give those digits the TLC they deserve! Spray 1 pump into palm and dip opposite nail into palm. Use circular motion to gently massage oil into nails and cuticles, one at a time, until absorbed. Repeat for other hand.</li> </ol>",,/curl-keeper-dry-oil-elixir-1-oz/

Well, you don&rsquo;t have to anymore, Jessicurl fans! After months of testing, we&rsquo;re super excited to introduce Spiralicious Styling Gel, the thicker, stronger hold styler for you&rsquo;ve been asking for.<br /><br /> Spiralicious is much thicker than Confident Coils and very gel-like in consistency but does not flake in the hair like many gels can. While it can dry crunchy, that initial crunch scrunches out really easily, leaving the hair very soft to the touch, but the curls hold up all day. No ramen-noodle curls here! One of the best parts about it is the frizz control. Seriously people, the frizz control on this stuff is NO JOKE! If you currently use Rockin&rsquo; Ringlets, you&rsquo;ll find that the two work together really well.

In one wash, it will help to ""reboot"" the curl pattern for a fresh start. Plus, it's safe to use on color-treated hair (but shouldn't be used directly after a coloring process).

Everyone knows that deep conditioning treatments work better with heat. Warm, moist heat opens the cuticles of your hair, allowing deep conditioning treatments and hot oil treatments to penetrate the hair where they can do the most good. Until now, you've had to plug in a conditioning cap or use some other external source of energy to get the heat needed to activate these deep conditioning treatments. The portable, disposable&nbsp;<span><span>HydraCap</span></span>&nbsp;uses the natural heat from your head along with its snug fit to produce the heat necessary to activate deep hair conditioning treatments. The Hydra-Cap is great to use after relaxers or hair coloring. It works well for hair that is stressed from too much dry heat from flat irons or blow dryers. Our&nbsp;<span><span>Hydracap</span></span>&nbsp;works on all hair types and its shrink-to-fit design allows it to work on every sized head.</p> <p><span>The&nbsp;</span><span><span>Hydracap</span></span><span>&nbsp;is economical and easy to use.</span></p> <ul> <li>Locks in moisture</li> <li>No drips</li> <li>Less Mess</li> <li>Easy hot oil treatments and deep conditioning in your own home</li> <li>Affordable- less than $1.00 per treatment!</li> </ul> <p>The HydraCap deep conditioning cap shrinks to fit your head using the hot air from an ordinary hair dryer. Hot air blown directly on your hair dries the hair out, which can cause damage and breakage. By shrinking the Hydra-Cap to your head, you capture moisture and heat and drive the deep conditioning treatment into the hair itself. All you need is the conditioning treatment or hot oil and an ordinary blow dryer to shrink the cap to fit your head. It's the snug fit that makes it so very different from an ordinary conditioning cap. Order your conditioning cap from Treasured Locks today!</p>",,/treasured-locks-hydracap-deep-conditioning-cap/
